## Welcome to Lance's Webpage.

### About Me.

I am a beginner at web developement and will be using this site to *showcase* my portfolio.



#### Portfolio.

> I also created and maintain the following site for a travel agency agent. [Bucket List Travel](http://www.blt2020.tk)


### Hobbies.

I am an avid photographer, please check out my photography on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lanceperry) 

I also am a **constructed-language** enthusiest. *Yo parla Interlingue* [Occidental website](https://occidental-lang.com/)
I also speak Esperanto, *Mi parolas Esperanton* [Esperanto](https://lernu.net/en) 
[Interslavic](http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/) is a language I do not yet speak... but I can understand a good bit of it. 
I do, however, speak Russian. *Я говорю по-русски*. 
I am also interested in the [Folksprak](https://www.facebook.com/groups/folksprak/) project which aims to develop an inter-germanic language. My personal interest can be found in the files section of the FaceBook group page called **Middelsprake**.

For fun, I am also using a language called [Langugu](https://vanege.github.io/Langugu/). This simple language is like a pidgeon or creole based on English, the explanation is given in Esperanto. Essentially langugu is a super-simplified form of English designed to be regular and easy to learn and use. 
*Mu speka langugu wito yu.* **I speak langugu with you.** It is a fun language to use and keeps the brain active.
